h1. FreeBuffersCache plugin for Server Density

h2. Yo! Where My RAM At?

This Server Density plugin (aka "quick hack") checks the true amount of "free" memory.  See http://www.linuxatemyram.com/ for details.

h2. Dude, Seriously, Where Is My RAM???

Servers with massive amounts of disk access (typically search/index/database servers) will often build a large disk cache.  Unfortunately, many tools check the "free" memory only and assume the server is running out of memory, when it is still available but currently held by buffers and cache.

Eg, in this example there's really 2.5GB available to applications.

<pre>
							 total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
	Mem:          7468       7413         54          0        421     2114
	-/+ buffers/cache:       4878       2590
	Swap:            0          0          0
</pre>

The above example is from a server running Elastic Search with a huge number of open files.  Check out this output from @slabtop@, sorted by cache size:

h2. Manual Installation

* Configure your agent so that it knows about plugins
* http://www.serverdensity.com/docs/agent/plugins/ 
* Install the plugin in your sd-agent plugins directory
* Move FreeBuffersCache.py into that directory 
* Restart the agent (service sd-agent restart)
* Head to https://youraccount.serverdensity.com/plugins/ and Add new plugin
* Add a plugin called FreeBuffersCache
* Edit the FreeBuffersCache plugin and create groups for the graphs (see the
* configuration section below)
